# Assignment Description

For this assignment, you will re-create various animations demonstrating a combination of toolbox functions and the rendering techniques you've already learned. The motivation for this is to help you become more familiar with toolbox functions as well as give you experience in producing a desired aesthetic.

Below are multiple examples of periodic animations with assigned point values. You are required to complete EITHER:
* One scene from the first list of easier animations and one scene from the second list of more challenging ones
* Three scenes from the first easier list.
* One Duck-Level-hard animation (at the very bottom)

You have three options for implementing these:
* Rasterizer, like homework 1
* Raymarcher / implicit surfaces, like homework 2
* Shadertoy 

If you'd like to implement any animations that are not listed below, you can make a _private_ post on Piazza and we will decide if they are appropriate for the assignment, and their difficulty classification. Check [/r/loadingicon](https://www.reddit.com/r/loadingicon) on Reddit for inspiration.

*Extra Credit*: you can earn extra credit by creating interesting twists e.g. materials and animations that are not in the original reference. Since we are grading reference matching, additional features must be toggleable, either by a GUI option in your webgl site or by a #define statement in your Shadertoy code. This must be described in your writeup. Additionally, some of the references have some attributes that are exceptionally difficult, and do not need to be implemented for full credit; we will note what these are and they can count for extra credit.

# Submission

You must submit a writeup for this assignment by 11:59 PM on Thursday, Feb. 9th to canvas *as a .pdf or .txt*. 
Writeups must include, for each shader:
* A link to the online implementation
* A link to the reference animation
* Description of techniques used to emulate the reference, for both motion and rendering
* If you implement extra credit, explain what it is and how to toggle it
