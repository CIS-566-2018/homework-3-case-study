For this assignment, you will re-create various animations demonstrating a combination of toolbox functions and the rendering techniques you've already learned. The motivation for this is to help you become more familiar with toolbox functions as well as give you experience in producing a desired aesthetic.

Below are multiple examples of periodic loading animations with assigned point values. You are required to complete EITHER:
* One scene from the first list of easier animations and one scene from the second list of more challenging ones
* Three scenes from the first easier list.

You may use your current OpenGL renderer or ray-marcher or you can create a Shadertoy account to complete the assignment. If you'd like to implement any animations that are not listed below, you can post on Piazza and we will decide if they are appropriate for the assignment.
